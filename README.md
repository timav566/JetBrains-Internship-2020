# Tasks for JetBrains Internship 2021 New Interactive Integrated Biological Analysis Service

Assignment As a test assignment, you are asked to perform a short analysis of test data. Modern biological methods allow you to measure the amounts of various proteins in blood plasma, usually presented in the form of a table with the values of each donor for each of the available proteins.

Take table data from file

Identify the 5 indicators that change the most during the aging process

Divide the age range into several ranges and perform a statistical test for equality of mean values between samples of the ranges (a standard t-test can be used)

Using python visualize the obtained values in the form of graphs, display the p-values obtained in the previous step

A Jupyter notebook containing code in Python programming language to solve the problem, which can be run using the Cell | Run All command, should be provided as a solution. All publicly available libraries for data analysis and visualization can be used.

Validation of Solutions All solutions will go through the following validation steps:

The path to the data file must be set in the first cell of the notebook

The code must run without errors from start to finish

Graphs should clearly show changes in the index with age and between age groups

Code review and final selection

How to do a code review?

Take care of the cleanliness of the code. Before submitting your solution, take a fresh look at your code and make sure the code uses clear names, no unused/commented code, no duplicates.
